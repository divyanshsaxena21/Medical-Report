# üè• **Medical Report Analysis - X-Ray Analysis** ü©ª

## Overview

**Medical Report Analysis** is a web-based application designed to analyze and interpret X-ray images. By integrating deep learning with modern web technologies, this project features a **React-based frontend** and a **deployed machine learning backend**. It leverages a **pre-trained model** for medical image classification, enhancing diagnostic capabilities with real-time predictions.

The application allows users to upload X-ray images, analyze them using a machine learning model, and view detailed insights and predictions about the medical condition represented in the images

## Features ‚ú®

* **X-ray Image Upload**: Users can upload X-ray images for analysis via the React interface.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

* **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Python (Flask or similar), TensorFlow/Keras
* **Deployment**: Vercel (for both frontend and backend)
* **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook for model training and testing

## Model Details üìä

* The `model.h5` file is a deep learning model trained on medical X-ray datasets. It uses **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification.
* The model can detect medical conditions from X-ray images and return relevant insights and predictions.
* Full training details and model architecture are available in the `X_RAY.ipynb` notebook file.
* The model is hosted on the live backend and accessed via API calls for real-time predictions.
